-5l0RlFcnEg,"Arctic cat,  how in the heck can announce a new platform, but alienate your prospective buyers. I check ed with snowmobile usa and they said yu weren't going to be there. This is painful to all of us. You guys are the reason I go to the show in novi,mi.. every year.  It really is b.s.  but yet you guys can go to Toronto or hay days.  Poor mgt. Decisions.  Your about to loose me and Others to your lack of mgt. Decisions",0
-5l0RlFcnEg,There coming out with a 862 motor so a 900 that is super charged,0
-5l0RlFcnEg,Too expensive. Too little too late. I’m glad they focused on the 600 trail market but frankly the company’s lucky to be alive at this time. Long time fan here but none of anything made since the last 500cc models of the mid teens has interested me. Mountain sleds drive the market these days which to me seems silly as there’s more to the snow belt than mountains. I’ll stick with my vintage sleds and remember when snowmobiles didn’t look like insects.,0
-5l0RlFcnEg,"How about an M1000 Turbo, just for fun?",0
-5l0RlFcnEg,"As a polaris guy, I admit it looks like Cat is back in the game! This could be the chassis that makes me switch, time will tell. My guess is Arctic Cat is coming out with a 900 or maybe even a 950 two stroke. Pair that with this brand new chassis, that could be an industry leader there.",3
-5l0RlFcnEg,Plastic running boards  I just hope for the guys who actually ride in cold temps they don’t snap,0
-5l0RlFcnEg,no update on the chain case or drive axle on brake side no more money from me ever,0
-5l0RlFcnEg,Arctic Cat still makes sleds?,1
-5l0RlFcnEg,"Very cool. But this not being available in the 800 mountain market is a huge miss. Polaris did a new engine and a turbo, Skidoo did a new chassis, and cat did nothing here again.",3
-5l0RlFcnEg,"Oh. And it changes everything

-5l0RlFcnEg,"Looks more like evolutionary, not ""revolutionary"". There's a difference",1
-5l0RlFcnEg,Looks great to me,1
-5l0RlFcnEg,Will the Yamacat use the same platform?,0
-5l0RlFcnEg,"Awesome cat, let’s set the competition back 😎👏",3
-5l0RlFcnEg,Nice upgrade......looks like a Polaris!,1
-5l0RlFcnEg,Looks cool as hell. The best gets even better! Can't wait to ride one and see for myself. Durability is critical. NO CHINESE BEARINGS PLEASE!!!,11
-5l0RlFcnEg,Looks very similar to  a ski doo,2
-5l0RlFcnEg,"On the trail, the problem has never been the chassis, but the hardness of the rear suspension....here we only mention the chassis....The competitors are still one step ahead, too bad 😡",4
-5l0RlFcnEg,"Guys will hate, they are just mad the other brands only got new plastics with there chassis last time",6
-5l0RlFcnEg,For the 2strokes only,0
-5l0RlFcnEg,"Nice. Interesting design for sure, we'll have to see how it'll do out on the snow!",11
-5l0RlFcnEg,I was really nervous for this..once i seen the first photos today i thought oh shit they didn't mess this one up at all and looks very aggressive,4
-5l0RlFcnEg,Why the fuck aren’t the headlights symmetrical? Looks so dumb,1
-5l0RlFcnEg,Why is Arctic cat always highlighting change when every company offers change. Bring it or don’t bring it at all. Too bad one day the head lights will come one and they might be in LED in 10 years.,0
-5l0RlFcnEg,Marketing team at arctic cat!! Wow. No facts. Just a cad design 60s video touting a lower CG. Lol. You’ll stay at the back of the pack…..,6
-5l0RlFcnEg,"And the new engine soon....AC doesn't rush out and build junk quickly like Polaris, then sell it, then issue 2 STOP orders. Pure junk. When AC brings it out, it will rock. Now, we have a belt drive finally, should be good. Big loss in weight right now..its a hit!!",26
-5l0RlFcnEg,Looking good cat! Welcome back👍,6
