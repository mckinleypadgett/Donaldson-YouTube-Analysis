27rnvRkE1OM,GM Why are we going all electric? Please tell me. You already think it will be a success. But reality it won't work,0
27rnvRkE1OM,You pulled your Twitter ads. You WOKE COWARDS. Boycott this discussing cancer of a company.,0
27rnvRkE1OM,GM‚Äôs CEO must GO I will no longer buy any GM vehicle as long as she is ceo,0
27rnvRkE1OM,My city just canceled the order of GM vehicles for its city public works and police departments over the Twitter move. Thank you for self exposing this company. I‚Äôll never buy a GM ever again as well,1
27rnvRkE1OM,"As far as I'm concerned as long as this company is playing politics I will never buy one of their vehicles. So expect GM to fail once again because they went ahead and took their stand well the people are about to take their stand too and the side she's falling on is very unpopular right now so,.. good riddance GM. Hope you all get trapped in a structure fire. Why you would put yourself on a list with Pfizer it's beyond me.. put your pronouns in your Twitter bio lady you know what I'm going to do I'm going to put my money where my mouth is. And check that out I'm going to be ready to buy a new vehicle within the next year, but because of these shenanigans I will not be buying a GM vehicle or a Cadillac,",0
27rnvRkE1OM,JUNK ALL JUNK GM,1
27rnvRkE1OM,"Go ahead, and dive into the Disney rabbit hole. If you're interested in free speech you better change your position and do it quickly.",1
27rnvRkE1OM,"Well, you blew it with me, I was a General Motors regular customer, but no longer, I believe in free speech, but if you aren't interested in that, see you!",1
27rnvRkE1OM,If you own a general motor's car take the emblem off and replace it with a twitter bird.,1
27rnvRkE1OM,No more Ads no more GM in my life. Boycotting Twitter is a shame. Y‚Äôall want a single brain customer üéÉü§Æü§Æü§Æ,1
27rnvRkE1OM,"Now that we know not to buy GM because of their support for loony leftists, what are some good vehicle manufacturers to look at?",0
27rnvRkE1OM,#BoyCottGM,1
27rnvRkE1OM,Worry less about social media and more about supplying parts for the vehicles you have sold.,2
27rnvRkE1OM,"I am fully restoring a Chevy pickup truck and have put $27,000 in the truck so far.  I will be removing the logos from my Chevy truck tomorrow.  

 Hell I might even put Twitter logos On it instead.   I bet that will catch some eyes. 

That's what I think about your anti-American views.",0
27rnvRkE1OM,"I'm a Ford and Chevy Person, but I can promise you I won't ever buy GM ever again in my entire life. I don't care if they start to make the world's best vehicle. 

They're an anti-American company. They don't value the constitution freedom of speech the way american companies should. 

GM as an american company is over. They may as well be recognized as a chinese company now.",0
27rnvRkE1OM,I love 2023 buick design = perfect,0
27rnvRkE1OM,Make America Great Again,2
27rnvRkE1OM,Your censorship bully move to not advertise on Twitter due to new owner is unacceptable.,8
27rnvRkE1OM,"GM purposely sold GM trucks knowing those low quality lifters were going to break.,basically shit on their customers even after they got a bail out that tax payers are accountable for .",1
27rnvRkE1OM,Me and family will no longer support a company who supports WOKE pedophilia.  . #biycottgm,0
27rnvRkE1OM,"Always had, but as of today, I have never been happier to own a Chevy.  It's good to know that General Motors hates the likes of me and over half of Americans just because they believe in constitutional free speech.  Wow, that was surprising.  But great to know those who hate you.",0
27rnvRkE1OM,"When you prioritize based on race, you're a racist company. If you leave Twitter you're against freedom of speech. You're showing your true agenda and that's why I won't buy anything GM related.",0
27rnvRkE1OM,"Pausing ads on Twitter because of your politics huh

YOU ARE A CAR MAKER NOT A DAMN POLITICAL ACTION GROUP. I WILL NEVER BUY GM AGAIN AFTER THIS INSULT",5
27rnvRkE1OM,"Leave twitter,  show your true agenda,  and then promptly go bankrupt.",6
27rnvRkE1OM,Don't think you won't get cancelled if you leave Twitter.    I'm already gearing yup to buy a Tesla.    LET THAT SINK IN !!!      üòÅ,7
27rnvRkE1OM,Planning on getting another 2500 truck when prices dip a bit. It will not be a Chevy if GM sides with the left over Elon Musks purchase of Twitter. I will also urge every Chevy owner I can to not buy another one. Politics and business need to stay separate..,4
27rnvRkE1OM,F ck GM.....Twitter shjt bags....bc your products,0
27rnvRkE1OM,Will GMC Sierra EV be a live event?,0
27rnvRkE1OM,you gave priority and attention to Brazilians in the creation of the automatic transmission... that's why my appreciation for general motors,0
27rnvRkE1OM,I have a better engine than tesla. better than the ones Elon musk is trying to build. #findnewroadsforever,0
27rnvRkE1OM,"Cadillac gives good advice. In Korea, SUVs like Ford's Raptor don't go around very often. Why? I don't like that kind of design. I like angled muscle-type sedans or sports sedans.",0
27rnvRkE1OM,"Corvette and Cadillac are the designs that do not lose to Ferrari and Rolls Royce. Ford seems to only like SUVs, so it's not popular in Korea.",0
27rnvRkE1OM,"Cadillac has many lines of muscle-type sedans with perfect design. Koreans don't like SUVs. Cadillac sedans are pretty, and SUVs are pretty. And Cadillac will be the best if it comes up with a design like the Corvette.",0
27rnvRkE1OM,"I bought my last GM product years ago. Now you have to pay $1500 up front for a subscription to on star. You don‚Äôt have a choice they include it in the price of the vehicle. I was gonna buy a new Silverado this year, but not anymore. I don‚Äôt want on star, and I don‚Äôt want to buy a subscription to it by force.",1
27rnvRkE1OM,Can GM please bring back Oldsmobile.,0

uTOzg8Tp4F0,Gimme a break GM,1
uTOzg8Tp4F0,I will not ever ! Buy a GM product again since your FORCING new car buyers to purchase 3 years of onstar and adding it into the price. This probably the most UNETHICAL practice I‚Äôve ever heard of. You are no longer ‚Äúprofessional grade‚Äù,0

uTOzg8Tp4F0,Whistling past the graveyard.,1
uTOzg8Tp4F0,Its called a gang.  Groups vs individuals in a competition to survive. Gangs,2
uTOzg8Tp4F0,GM has not competitive advantage. Go work at Tesla.,2
uTOzg8Tp4F0,A vehicle for the rich and stupid not practical too expensive and a recycling nightmare the era of bling is back common sense is out the window.,0
uTOzg8Tp4F0,Worked at GM for three years two decades ago. They were competetive and performed well in the market. The direction that they've been going through since the bailout seems like they will be out of business after the next market collapse. Tesla and Ford are eating them for lunch and that shows up in the quality and competitiveness of the product.,3
uTOzg8Tp4F0,This is where they produce eco-piglets?,0
uTOzg8Tp4F0,GM got the Corvette right. ü§ûHopefully the UAW and management work together.,0
uTOzg8Tp4F0,One day it will come A I into GM it will completely take over your jobs and nobody at GM will have a job because of A I intelligent robot. Will completely take over GM and run it.,0
uTOzg8Tp4F0,"NOW I see the reason for the decline in quality at GM!  Too many women.  There's a lot of time spent on gossip and bickering, and less time spent on getting the quality work done. 
Wise up GM, after the #metoo fake news exploded, hiring females is risky practice. Amber #poopthebed Turd backs up the truth. #shelies #nohire #nomentor",0
uTOzg8Tp4F0,"GM is doomed I'm afraid. They haven't procured enough batteries to produce enough vehicles. The vehicles are way too heavy, so the ranges are poor. They're going to be overwhelmed by Tesla and Chinese manufacturers who are more nimble and innovative. GM, you blew it. You made the first viable electric car, then let the dealers and oil companies bully you into scrapping them. Customers loved them, but you put yourself first. Shame on you, you deserve what's coming.",10
