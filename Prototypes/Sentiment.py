# Donaldson Query Sentiment

# Dogma: sentiment_query_score = sum(channel_score)
#        channel_score = sum(video_score)
#        video_score = (video_views/average_views) * sum(compound_sentiment * likes)

# this script will demonstrate how information is gathered from a clean .csv file and video_score is calculated

    # 1) can interpret emojis
    # 2) No special consideration for non-english sentences
            # every non-english sentence returns a compound score of 0
