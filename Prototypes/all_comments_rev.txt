0,There coming out with a 862 motor so a 900 that is super charged
5,Kyle runs funny as hell👹
13,Just AWESOME!!!
2,Too expensive. Too little too late. I’m glad they focused on the 600 trail market but frankly the company’s lucky to be alive at this time. Long time fan here but none of anything made since the last 500cc models of the mid teens has interested me. Mountain sleds drive the market these days which to me seems silly as there’s more to the snow belt than mountains. I’ll stick with my vintage sleds and remember when snowmobiles didn’t look like insects.
7,I just bought one of these off of Facebook marketplace for 6K it’s really nice
2,Arctic Cat still makes sleds?
1,"How about an M1000 Turbo, just for fun?"
13,Specify the goal and need money
3,"As a polaris guy, I admit it looks like Cat is back in the game! This could be the chassis that makes me switch, time will tell. My guess is Arctic Cat is coming out with a 900 or maybe even a 950 two stroke. Pair that with this brand new chassis, that could be an industry leader there."
4,Plastic running boards  I just hope for the guys who actually ride in cold temps they don’t snap
1,Usually you see one cat and 4 skidoos following then the next year you just see 5 skidoos.....
11,no update on the chain case or drive axle on brake side no more money from me ever
9,Hopefully the chain case doesn’t explode on these ones.
1,Arctic Cat still makes sleds?
6,"Very cool. But this not being available in the 800 mountain market is a huge miss. Polaris did a new engine and a turbo, Skidoo did a new chassis, and cat did nothing here again."
5,😳 𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚖𝚘𝚜𝚖
3,"Looks more like evolutionary, not ""revolutionary"". There's a difference"
15,Looks great to me
7,Will the Yamacat use the same platform?
2,"Awesome cat, let’s set the competition back 😎👏"
1,Nice upgrade......looks like a Polaris!
1,Looks cool as hell. The best gets even better! Can't wait to ride one and see for myself. Durability is critical. NO CHINESE BEARINGS PLEASE!!!
1,Looks very similar to  a ski doo
9,"On the trail, the problem has never been the chassis, but the hardness of the rear suspension....here we only mention the chassis....The competitors are still one step ahead, too bad 😡"
4,"If it is made for everyone call it - Compromise - because if you think it will work for everyone to many compromises were made! I do not want an all inclusive woke LGBT,QRFT accepting design because there is do all design."
2,"Guys will hate, they are just mad the other brands only got new plastics with there chassis last time"
2,For the 2strokes only
7,"Nice. Interesting design for sure, we'll have to see how it'll do out on the snow!"
1,I was really nervous for this..once i seen the first photos today i thought oh shit they didn't mess this one up at all and looks very aggressive
2,Why the fuck aren’t the headlights symmetrical? Looks so dumb
3,Why is Arctic cat always highlighting change when every company offers change. Bring it or don’t bring it at all. Too bad one day the head lights will come one and they might be in LED in 10 years.
8,C'est tu encore un 800?
10,Marketing team at arctic cat!! Wow. No facts. Just a cad design 60s video touting a lower CG. Lol. You’ll stay at the back of the pack…..
4,"And the new engine soon....AC doesn't rush out and build junk quickly like Polaris, then sell it, then issue 2 STOP orders. Pure junk. When AC brings it out, it will rock. Now, we have a belt drive finally, should be good. Big loss in weight right now..its a hit!!"
36,Looking good cat! Welcome back👍
3,"Alles sehr schön. Aber zuerst zusammen die Nummern 10 und 1. Eine gedangsiemm.ONLINE Brünette und eine anderec Blondine. Es wäre unfair, wenn ich 4 wählen würde"
5,No real facts but worth looking in to .
9,Nice
9,Первый ☝️
1,"❤Only for fans over 18 year⤵️ Alles sehr schön. Aber zuerst zusammen die Nummern 10 und 1. Eine warmthhh.Online Brünette und eine andere Blondine. Es wäre unfair, wennf ich 4 wählen würde"
4,wow so exciting. cat 4 life. always
3,Z cross would be a sweet name
5,"With this much hype it would be a shame if it didn't live up to the pre-reveal... the worse thing you can do to your consumers is over sell and under provide, that creates distaste and spelled the end. Who knows this could be a grasping at straws, last ditch attempt for AC. I hope not but an affordable electric sled could be a brand saver."
2,They have had the same sled for like 10 years it better look way different and better be something different than the same old 800 motor that is a turd compared to the rest it’s gonna take a lot for them to rebrand them self or call it revolutionary
6,"I looked over for past few days.. to study the outlines, and do renderings.. I even took snipnits of the video and zoom and change color, sharper, or hazier, or clearly or whatever, I drew them.  I can see clearly if you change the light and balance.  The front has that 5 headlights.  all LED.  They then also have this unattractive lines on the cowl right in front of the headlights.  It reminded me of SKIDOO!  This is very uncharacteristic of Arctic Cat.  And the short nose part of the cowl.  Kind of like a throwback to the 1960s snowmobiles such as the Panther platform, Skidog platform (1969 Skidoo), and I can see tall spindle connecting the ski.  Not that wide out between spindles and the cowl-belly pan.  The sides look almost straight down like the old Panther used to be in 1966 to 1970. I do not see any vents.  Electric snowmobile?  Possible.  The suspension.. on the other hand. Of course hard to see, so I did all adjustments, I can see the suspension design is similar to my design I have had for at least 20 to 25 years.  It is also almost the same as Polaris Axis rear suspension that Polaris no longer produce now.  But it is more like 1979 TrailCat platform suspension.  I see the rail.. mono like they call it Alpha platform slide rail?  Possible.  The tunnel appeared long but much shorter on each side which is why the suspension appeared to look like Polaris Axis'.  The flap.. it looked more plastic than rubber because of its look.  Flaps have come a long way.  It is a chevron bend down.. Remember Pontiac Atzek rear windshield?  That is the same bend down look.  And has trim for the flap.  Now that is real cool design.  The seat seem to be short, not long but I can see the lift bar on the back on there.  No tail lights on huh?  Have to have it on if the front is on!  Why was it off, Arctic Cat?   I know its for a show, Arctic Cat but technically supposed to have it on!  Its the law!  The tunnel seem to have something on the behind the seat. Was that a trunk?"
5,I love their snowmobiles
1,CATRYX
2,Arctic cat baby 🤘😼
